# Quiz Results Sharing Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation steps for adding two key features to the Quiz Insanity application:

1. **Twitter Share Button**: Allow users to share their quiz results on Twitter
2. **Quiz Results Image**: Enable users to download a square image showing their quiz score

## Implementation Location
These features will be added to the QuizTaker.vue component, specifically in the Quiz Results section that appears after a user completes a quiz.
